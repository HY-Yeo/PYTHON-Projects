"""
Stage 5:
Write a program that will work endlessly to make coffee for all
interested persons until the shutdown signal is given.
Introduce two new options: "remaining" and "exit".

Do not forget that you can be out of resources for making coffee.
If the coffee machine doesn't have enough resources to make coffee,
the program should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee.

And the last improvement to the program at this step â€” if the user types "buy"
to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind,
hey should be able to type "back" to return into the main cycle
